# My Island On The Net

Hi there! I'm Julien. Software-builder, pizza-lover, dad, human being.

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m currently working on

I'm building tools and the internal platform at [Valence Labs](https://www.valencelabs.com/), to help my very smart colleagues apply machine learning and other AI techniques towards the goal of accelerating drug discovery.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m currently learning

How we can leverage the new generation of services and framework, like Next.js, Clerk and Render, to accelerate how we build our tools.
